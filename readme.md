## Short description
This is an experimental test app. It works like the UPIC of Iannis Xenakis or synthesizes images as sound. In particular, this application uses hand-drawn sketches to convert music and synthesizers.		

- First, load a hand-drawn image (jpg or png, key : 'o')      
- Moving and set up a position of the red wavetable zone and the green play zone      
- Change the contrast parameters of the selected area      
- Playing and stopping is by spacebar      
- Optional parameters are speed, frequency, overlap      

A hand-drawn sketch image should be on the white background. If the background of the image is darker than a sketch, the 'Invert colors' option creates a better play and wavetable area.

There will be more features and updates.
